General Software Development
Learn about general software development aspects, such as application lifecycle management and application specifications. These two concepts cover a general understanding of how software applications are created, deployed, and maintained by application developers.
Core Programming
Becoming successful in programming doesn't require a deep understanding of computer hardware, but a general understanding of how a computer stores and processes information helps the programmer become more efficient at writing code. In this module, viewers will be presented with core programming concepts, such as covering how computers store information using data, structures, and how algorithms are used to solve real-world problems in a computer application. Other core programming concepts are covered, in addition to showing how to use decision structures and repetition in your programs, plus a discussion on programming errors.

Object-Oriented Programming
Most programming tasks today revolve around object-oriented programming (OOP). This section covers how objects created in code can mimic real-world objects helping the programmer to better solve problems with their applications through modeling of the real-world objects represented in code.

Web Applications
This section will present the viewer with a general understanding of what web-based applications are and how they are used in providing functionality and services to users and other programs.

Desktop Applications
Although the Internet has created a move to more and more web-based applications and services, a fair bit of development is still accomplished for the desktop or laptop computer. This section presents on overview of the various types of applications a developer may be involved in creating for this platform.

Understand Databases
Almost all applications developed today rely on data of some kind. Programmers are expected to know what a database is and how to extract information from one. This section provides a high-level overview of databases and shows how to extract, insert, update, and delete data in database systems.

Is This for Me?
This section closes out the course with a discussion on why someone might want to pursue software development as a hobby or a career.
